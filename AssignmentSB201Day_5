Q1. Explain MVC architecture?

Answer:
 
Spring MVC architecture:
========================

It has three main components:
-Model
-View
-Controller


Model(Java bean,+SL+DAL)
========================
Handle data logically so it basically deals with data. The model is actually connected 
to the database so anything you do with data. Adding or retrieving data is done in the model component. 

It is known as the lowest level which means it is responsible for maintaining data. 

View(jsp)
Data representation is done by the view component. 
It actually generates UI or user interface for the user. 
So at web applications view component will be Html/CSS part.


Controller(Servlet)
It’s known as the main man because the controller is the component that enables the interconnection
between the views and the model so it acts as an intermediary. The controller doesn’t takes part in handling data logic.

Q2. What is the difference between SOAP and Rest API's?

Answer:

SOAP(Simple Oblject Access Protocol ):
======================================
--> It is a xml based protocol, to communication between client application and server application.
--> Since it is xml based, so it is aslo plateform indipendent.
--> Creating web services using SOAP are having weight.

ex.
<student>
	<roll>100</roll>
	<name></name>
	<marks></marks>
</student>

REST(Representeational State Transfer)full:
===========================================

--> This architecture allows us to create a web srevice with the required operations or functionality and expose them using "HTTP Protocol".
    and allowes client to access them with the help of http protocol without any extra binding or any xml files.
--> The web serviecs created by RESTfull architecture are light weight.
--> In RESTfull, the web service class called as "rootresource" class. And each method is called "resource".



Q3. What are servlets ? What is the role of request Dispatcher Servlet.

Answer:

Servlet:
========


--> Servlets work on the server-side and are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the webserver.
--> Servlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. 
--> They are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce the response, then send a response back to the webserver.

Dispatcher Servlet:
===================

--> Using the RequestDispatcher object we send a request to other resources which include (servlet, HTML file, or JSP file). 
--> A RequestDispatcher object can be used to forward a request to the resource or to include the resource in a response. 
The resource can be dynamic or static.
