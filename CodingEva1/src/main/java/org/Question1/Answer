Circular Dependency:==>
            Suppose we have 2 beans A and B, where A depends upon B and B depends upon A, and in both A and B
            parameterized constructors are defined for injecting the dependency, then it will cause a circular dependency
            and it will throw an exception:.
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:- to solve the circular dependency injection problem, at least one side we need to change the
dependency injection type from the constructor to setter injection.
