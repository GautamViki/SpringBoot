Tight coupling ==>
        If the dependent class wants to call the methods of the dependency class then, it has to create an object of its
        dependency class, and then the dependent class can call the functionality of its dependency class.
        Now suppose, if any changes are made in the dependency class and if it is forced to do the changes inside the
        dependent class also then we can say that both classes are tightly coupled with each other.


Loose coupling ==>
        n simple words, loose coupling means they are mostly independent. If the only knowledge that
        class A has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and class B
        are said to be loosely coupled. In order to over come from the problems of tight coupling between
        objects, spring framework uses dependency injection mechanism with the help of POJO/POJI model
         and through dependency injection its possible to achieve loose coupling.
