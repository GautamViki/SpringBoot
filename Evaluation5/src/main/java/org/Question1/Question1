Question 1) What is lazy loading and eager loading in hibernate?

Ans: Lazy Loading:=====
 In Lazy loading, associated data loads only when we explicitly call getter or size method.
 ManyToMany and OneToMany associations used lazy loading strategy by default.
 It can be enabled by using the annotation parameter:fetch = FetchType.LAZY.
 Initial load time much smaller than Eager loading.

Eager Loading:======
 In Eager loading, data loading happens at the time of their parent is fetched.
ManyToOne and OneToOne associations used lazy loading strategy by default.
It can be enabled by using the annotation parameter:fetch = FetchType.EAGER.
Loading too much unnecessary data might impact performance.
