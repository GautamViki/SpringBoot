A) Explain @Cascade and @mappedBy annotations.

Ans: @Cascade: ===
Cascading is a feature in Hibernate, which is used to manage the state of
the mapped entity whenever the state of its relationship owner (superclass) affected.
When the relationship owner (superclass) is saved/ deleted, then the mapped entity associated with it
 should also be saved/ deleted automatically.

@mappedBy: ===
Once we have defined the owning side of the relationship,
	 Hibernate already has all the information it needs to map that relationship in our database.
	 To make this association bidirectional, all we'll have to do is to define the referencing side.
	 The inverse or the referencing side simply maps to the owning side. We can easily use the
	  mappedBy attribute of @OneToMany annotation to do so.

B) What is ORM in Hibernate?

Ans: ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data
 between relational databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc.
